## Number Guessing Game

This program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

**File:** `Number-guessing-game.cpp`

## Simple Calculator

This program performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

**File:** `Simple_calculator.cpp`

## Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other. The game handles displaying the board, player input, updating the board, checking for wins or draws, switching players, and displaying the result.

**File:** `Tic-Tac-Toe.cpp`

## To-Do List

This is a console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The program provides a basic menu-driven interface for managing the tasks.

**File:** `to-do-list.cpp`
